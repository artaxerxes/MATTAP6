function D = dirdir( path )
% DIRDIR List subdirectories of a directory.
%     DIR directory_name lists the subdirectories of a directory.
%  
%     D = DIRDIR('directory_name') returns the results in an M-by-1
%     structure with the fields: 
%         name  -- filename
%         date  -- modification date
%         bytes -- number of bytes allocated to the file
%  
%     If no subdirectories are present, an empty structure (0x0) is returned.
%     See also DIR, WHAT, CD, TYPE, DELETE.
